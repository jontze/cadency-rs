# Cadency-rs

A discord bot written in **Rust** with the help of [serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) and [songbird](https://github.com/serenity-rs/songbird).
Initially this was intended to be a rust clone of [my typescript discord bot](https://github.com/jontze/Cadency) but currently **Cadency-rs** offers more features and is more up to date as it's already using the discord **slash commands**.

> WARNING: Cadency is not production ready! It might eat your laundry.

## Installation

The recommended way to install and run **Cadency-rs** is with Docker, as the Docker image installs several libraries and binaries that are required to use or build the bot.

1. Pull the image from the **ghcr.io** registry (`main` pulls the latest stable build, `develop` latest development build, `vX.X.X` pulls a fixed version)

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/jontze/cadency_rs:main
```

2. Start a container and pass your discord bot token to the container by setting the `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable and optional specify the log level e.g. `RUST_LOG="cadency=info"`.
3. Invite the bot to your discord server, discord offers great [documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started) on how to do this.

## Example docker setup

Replace the TOKEN_HERE with your token:

```sh
docker run --name cadency_rs -d -it --rm -e DISCORD_TOKEN=DISCORD_TOKEN_HERE ghcr.io/jontze/cadency_rs:develop
```

This runs the container in detatched mode (background) and removes it when it stops running. This makes sure that you are always using an up-to-date version of cadency-rs.  
To stop the container, execute the following command and substitute ID for the id that was returned when running the docker run command:

```sh
docker stop ID
```

## Contributing

1. Install the latest stable rust toolchain: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
2. Intall [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#installation)
3. Clone the repository
4. Install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/). It is reccomended you install the [yt-dlp build](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds), as this is used in the Docker image as well and includes additional bug-fixes.
5. Create a discord bot so you can run the bot local on your computer
6. Set the environment variables that are listed as example in [.env.example](./.env.example)
7. You should be able to run `cargo test` and `cargo run` successfully

## Note

You may have to install the **development** versions of Opus (opus-dev / opus-devel) and/or cmake (check your distribution for specific name). The best way to test if you have those installed, is to run `cargo test` or `cargo run` and see if any errors mentions either package.
